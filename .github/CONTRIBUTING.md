### Making your Changes

#### 1. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch from the main branch. Your branch name should be descriptive of the changes you are making along with your first name. Some ideas to get you started:

- Branch name format:
- For documentation: `docs-[issue-id]`
- For bugs: `bugs-[issue-id]`
- Example: `docs[#123]`

To create a new branch, use the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

#### 2. Make your Changes

By following these steps, you will create a new page or you can edit an existing page.

### Creating a New Page in Astro Starlight

To create a new page in Astro Starlight, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Pages Directory**
   - Go to the `src/content/docs/` directory in your project. This is where all the pages for your Astro Starlight site are located.

2. **Create a New Markdown File**
   - Create a new file with the `.mdx` extension. For example, `new-page.mdx` (both .md & .mdx are accepted)

3. **Add Frontmatter to the New Page**
   - At the top of your new Markdown file, add frontmatter in YAML format. This includes metadata for your page. Here's an example:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: "New Page Title"
     description: "A brief description of the new page."
     layout: "@/layouts/BaseLayout.astro"
     ---
     ```
     Adjust the `title`, `description`, and `layout` as needed.

4. **Write Content for the New Page**
   - Below the frontmatter, add the content for your new page using Markdown syntax. For example:
     ```markdown
     # Welcome to the New Page
     
     This is the content of your new page. You can add text, images, links, and more using Markdown.
     ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/CodeQuestic/OpenPrep/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to open a pull request for your changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You are to make only `one contribution` per `pull request`. It makes it easier to review and merge. If you want to add `multiple contributions` or if you have solved `multiple issues`, create `separate pull requests` for each.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you begin with coding, please ensure that you create a [new issue](https://github.com/CodeQuestic/OpenPrep/issues) detailing the new feature you wish to implement and get assigned to it. Pull requests will only be accepted if the code address the existing issue assigned to you. Furthermore, if there are other existing issues you'd like to contribute to, you can request to be assigned to them.


#### 3. Commit your Changes

Your commit message should give a concise idea of the issue you are solving. Please be specific about the commit message.

To commit your changes, run the following command:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

Eg:

```bash
git commit -m "adding new api for dynamic users"
```

Push your local commits to your remote repository.

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```
